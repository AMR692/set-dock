# set-dock
AppleScript for setting the Dock to a set of applications &amp; folders of your choice

  * Does not require installation of any other software
  * Intended to be run as an application with user interaction. If you want something that runs silently in the background, you should probably use `docklib` or `dockutil` instead.
